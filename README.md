The webpage was designed to show customers what they can expect in the restaurant. It is calm, inviting and easy on the eyes.

### Colour

For the color theme, I used restaurant's background color as the reference. After some research I decided to use the Mysts of Dawn Color Palette which fits pretty good with restaurant's logo.
<br>
